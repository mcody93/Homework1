## ***Overview and Origin***

Betterment is a rob-advisory company. According to the company's website and Wikipedia, Betterment was founded in 2008 by Jon Stein and Eli Broverman and incorporated on April 7, 2009. Betterment was founded after the financial crisis with a mission to support regular, lower net worth people with an understanding of investing and an easy to use platform with access to low cost ETFs. Investors can easily enter their information (age, risk tolerance, etc.) and financial goals and the platform generates personalized investment solutions for them. The company is currently private. According to the website and Crunchbase, Betterment has raised $435M in 10 rounds of funding (Series A through F).

## ***Business Activities***


The most critical financial issues facing Betterment (and other robo-advisories) are low margins due to the low fee structure and the relatively high costs associated with finding new clients. Given larger banks are developing similar technologies increases the aforementioned risks for companies like Betterment even more.

Betterment's intended customers are everyday "Main Street" investors with an extremely wide range of capital (minimum account level is $10 and a higher end premium service is available at $100,000). This indicates that the potential customer base is massive. Currently, according to Forbes, approximately $1.64 trillion worldwide is managed by robo-advisors and that is expected to reach $3.19 trillion by 2027. According to a study referenced in the same Forbes article, 63% of people who currently do not use robo-advisors suggested they would consider it in the next year. 

Betterment's specific competitive advantages are their low account minimums ($10 as mentioned above) and portfolio customizability relative to peers including some extremely robust goal-setting tools. 

Specifically, Betterment employs Monte Carlo simulations and the Black-Litterman model, an allocation model, to service their clients from a portfolio construction standpoint. According to a TechBrew article, Betterment does not rely solely on AI and ML because after testing, there were many occurrences of these advanced technologies overfitting models. 

Betterment uses Flutter (an open-sourced UI software development kit) for their applications per the company's engineering blog. They also use Flutter to conduct end-to-end testing to ensure the systems are working as intended which is apparently much easier via Flutter than some of the alternatives. The blog continues to detail how Betterment also implements a host of APIs.

## ***Landscape***

Betterment is in the robo-advisory domain of the financial industry.

The major trend in robo-advisories is the move to a more hybrid model of robo-advisories with the robo-advisor technology working together with dedicated professionals who make themselves available to answer specific questions and provide human support to customers. Additionally, the offerings are becoming more personalized with client-specific risk assessments and even thematic investment opportunities (green, social, etc.). Vanguard and Betterment have shifted to this model. 

Other major players in the space include large financial industry players like Vanguard Robo-Advisors and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios. However, Wealthfront, Personal Capital Advisors, Bloom, and Acorns are also players in the industry.

## ***Results***

According to an article by Brookings, robo-advisors are reducing inequalities in the investment space, closing the gap between the wealthy and lower net worth investors given the fact that human advisors are monetarily incentivized to seek only wealthier clientele. Given the aforementioned growth in robo-advised assets over time, it is intriguing to see robo-advisors provide access to the regular everyday investor.

Given the low margins in robo-advising, a core metric is Assets under Management (AuM). As of July 2022, Betterment ranked third in robo-advisories in terms of AuM (right behind Vanguard and Schwab) per an article in Forbes. Betterment is also highly regarded for their return profiles and platform (ranked best overall in March 2023 by CNBC). 

Betterment continues to respond to trends in investing. According to Investopedia, Betterment began offering a cryptocurrency offering to investors in late 2022 after a period of beta testing the platform. It is imperative for Betterment and other robo-advisories to react to trends and investor wants in order to stay competitive.

## ***Recommendations***

According to Bankrate, a major drawback to Betterment is they do not provide direct indexing (owning the actual stocks of an index as opposed to the ETF). The ability to direct index (DI) provides clients with tax loss harvesting benefits as they can pick specific stocks to sell, realize capital losses, and redeploy the capital in winners as opposed to only being able to sell the ETF which could be mixed in terms of gains/losses. In my opinion, Betterment should develop this capability in order to pose a greater competitive threat to Vanguard and Schwab. The DI capability would likely entice a large number of higher AUM clients as tax loss harvesting matters more to higher net worth individuals. As long as Betterment offers an attractive fee (as they do for other services) and maintains the excellent overall experience, DI would be a huge tailwind for them. 

According to an article by the Financial Times, providing DI would require a significant investment in resources and coders to create the DI platform if Betterment decided to create it in-house. The new models would need to understand the portfolio rebalancing and optimization schemas associated with DI as well as tax loss harvesting in order to create efficient tools for investors. Given there are less than 300 employees at Betterment, this might be better suited to be outsourced. 

According to the Financial Times and a press release by Charles Schwab, Schwab rolled out their own in-house DI platform without partnering with another firm. Also, Fidelity added 12,000 new jobs to expand into new areas including DI. The fact that this appears to be a large investment for bigger firms would further support the fact that Betterment should consider outsourcing/working closely with a development partner to create the DI capabilities.
